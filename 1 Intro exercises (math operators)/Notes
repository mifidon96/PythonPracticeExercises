### I learned from this that you should always read over and look for typos first
# before tearing your hair out over whether the logic is correct ###

Ex_13
### I learned from this that you should not use so many numbers in your code
# and instead should set them as variables. I also did not make use of the
# "%" math operator which gives the remainder, i.e. no need for
#
# remain -= loonie * 100
#
# You can also perform calculations within a print() statement, e.g.
# print("", cents // CENTS_PER_TOONIE, "toonies") ###

Ex_15
### I learnt in this that it is good practice to assign constant variables at the
# beginning of your program, then take input, then calculate. ###

Ex_17
### I Learned that you cannot perform calculations in print statement IF there
# is a "%" marker in the string print statement, i.e CANNOT do
# print("This would cost approximately %.2f $" % cost_cents/100 )
#
# Would instead have to do
# print("This would cost approximately", cost_cents/100, "$" )
###

Ex_25
### I learned from this that %d is used to format decimals (integers), %02d
# specifies a decimal integer using 2 digits with a leading 0 if necessary ###

Ex_28
### Can use round function to round floating point numbers to closest integer ###

Ex_32
### min() and max() are functions and can simply be passed comma separated
# variables ###

Ex_33
### I learned the new line marker \n and that you can start a new line of code
# using the \ character (so code can be split up for easy reading and to fit
# into page) ###
