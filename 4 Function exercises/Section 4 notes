### In this exercise I learnt the use of the '^' XOR operator ###

### I learned a lot in this exercise. Use of the string.replace(x,y) functions
# which replaces all instances of x in the string with y. I also learned a
# valuable lesson in the order of operations, where I first used the
# string.replace() function but would then overwrite this in a later operation.

### In this exercise I learned about the string.strip(), .lstrip(), and .rstrip()
# functions which strip all leading and tailing, leading and tailing characters
# resp. (e.g string.strip("xyz")). A blank parameter will strip whitespace.
# I also learned how to stop a the main() function running automatically when
# this file is imported.
# The __name__ variable is automatically assigned a value by Python when the
# program starts running. It contains "__main__" when the file is executed
# DIRECTLY by Python. It contains the name of the module when the file is imported
# into another program. ###

### I have learned a very valuable lesson! If you call a function and assign the
# returned result as a variable, NEVER CALL THE VARIABLE THE SAME NAME AS THE
# FUNCTION! Had this issue for the line randPass = randPass(), where the function
# returns a string and then the computer reads randPass() NOT as a function, but
# as a string with () next to it, which generates the 'not callable' error,
# which makes sense as the line: "string"() is wrong. ###

### My solution here is far longer than the one expected by Ben (~ 41 lines),
# however my solution is more general and can be used as a basis for the next
# exercise which converts arbitrary bases. ###
